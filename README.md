# 👋 Welcome to Web-and-Social-Media-Analytics Project! 📊📈

## 📚 Business Understanding:
The goal of this project is to help a mobile phone manufacturer based in the US to understand their competitors and the preferences of their users. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews and social media data, the company can identify the features that result in positive/negative sentiments, design effective marketing campaigns, and decide the price of their products. The objective is to increase market share and brand value by developing a new product optimally and creating effective marketing strategies.

## 📊 Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is collected from various sources, including social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as review sites like Amazon, Best Buy, and others. The data includes text reviews, ratings, and other metadata related to mobile phones of different brands.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing:
The data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant data, such as ads and spam, and to extract relevant features, such as the sentiment of the reviews, the brand of the phone, and the features mentioned in the reviews. The text data is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters, and then transformed into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words or word embeddings.

## 📈 Data Analysis:
The data is analyzed using various machine learning and natural language processing techniques to extract insights and identify patterns. Sentiment analysis is performed to identify the features that result in positive/negative sentiments, and topic modeling is used to identify the most common topics discussed in the reviews. Competitor analysis is performed to compare the pricing and market share of different brands, and social network analysis is used to identify the major competitors in the market.

## ⚙️ Model Building:
Machine learning models are built to predict the sentiment of reviews and identify the topics discussed in the reviews. Supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are used to predict sentiment, while unsupervised learning algorithms such as Naive bayes are used for topic modeling.

## 📊 Results:
The results of the analysis are presented in a clear and concise manner, including visualizations such as word clouds, heatmaps, and bar charts. The insights are used to develop effective marketing strategies and optimize the development of a new product, leading to an increase in market share and brand value.

## 🎉 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of web and social media analytics to extract insights and identify patterns from large datasets. By analyzing the sentiment of reviews and social media data, companies can gain valuable insights into their competitors and the preferences of their users, leading to the development of effective marketing strategies and optimal product development.
